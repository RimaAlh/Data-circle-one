# A real time dashboard for daily report of Covid-19 cases
The project involves building a live interactive analytics dashboard using extracted COVID data from the Web Service provided by ESRI website and the John Hopkins University. The link to the web services are: 

1. https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/bbb2e4f589ba40d692fab712ae37b9ac_1/api 
2. https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data

The main library used for this project is the dash module from Plotly combined with Pandas.
The outcome is to build a dashboard that provides real time analytics of Covid-19 incidence around the world using advanced visualizations.
